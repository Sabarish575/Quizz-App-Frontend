## 🔄 Demo Mode (Development Only)

The current implementation includes a **Role Switcher** at the top of the dashboard that allows you to switch between roles instantly. This is for demonstration purposes and should be removed in production.

**To test different views:**
1. Click on "USER", "CREATOR", or "ADMIN" toggle buttons
2. The dashboard will instantly update to show that role's view

---

## 🔐 Production Implementation

In a production environment:

1. **Remove the Role Switcher**:
   ```javascript
   // Remove the Paper component with ToggleButtonGroup
   ```

2. **Get user role from authentication**:
   ```javascript
   // Instead of:
   const [userRole, setUserRole] = useState('admin');
   
   // Use:
   const { user } = useAuth(); // From your auth context
   const userRole = user.role; // 'user', 'creator', or 'admin'
   ```

3. **Add route protection**:
   - Use ProtectedRoute component
   - Verify role permissions server-side
   - Redirect unauthorized users
